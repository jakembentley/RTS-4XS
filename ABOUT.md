# RTS-4XS

In the wake of the singularity, an entity steps onto the cosmic stage. At the brink of civilization's collapse, they discovered a means of directly connecting all forms of life. Once connected, internal conflict became obsolete. Through key developments in *Automation*, *Robotics*, and *Genetic Engineering,* populations have become just an additional resource all angled towards a singular purpose: To tame the universe. 

Develop these branches of technology to fit the universe for your civilization. Generate **Von Neumann Probes [VNPs]** and provide them with a **Task Order** to expand your capabilites as they venture out across the stars. 



**Specifications**
When opening the Machine Management Pane, your saved **specifications** will be presented to you. Modify or deploy these specifications by clicking on them. A specific specification will include the **Task Order** assigned  and the **Constraints** of that class of VNPs, specifications can be customized or left to their default setting. 

**Task Order**
A Task order is the hierarchy of actions assigned to a specification. Task orders are basic tasks available to the specification and a given specification will carry out tasks in the order provided. Specifications are assigned basic task orders and constraints while **Clusters** are assigned **compound** task orders and constraints.

**Constraints**
Constraints are parameters that typically restrict the degree to which a specification performs a task. These enable control flow between the heirarchy. Constraints supercede the task order.

**Clusters**
A Cluster is a group of specifications. Each cluster is provided with a **compound** task order. The number of clusters available to a player is at least one and scales according to the base-2 logarithm of the players total VNP force. 

**The Machine Management Pane**
In addition to managing specifications, the machine management pane enables the player to requires the player to specify at least one Cluster. The propo



Your arsenal of VNPs will reproduce in accordance to its specilizations specified rate seen in the Machine Management Pane. Your VNPs will double in accordance with their construction order. If your resources are depleted replication will not occur. 

**Harvesting Rate**

Your harvesting rate is the rate at which resources are extracted from a *source.* The **local harvesting rate** is the harvesting rate within a given solar system relevant to any artifical entity that orbits the solar system. The **global harvesting rate** is the total rate of production for a given player across all systems they occupy.

2. Object of the Game
 There are three ways to win the game:
   A. Religious Victory -- you have missionized the universe, all systems observe  your religion.
   B. Industrial Victory -- you are a prolific builder and have successfully constructed megastructure(s) in 100 systems.
   C. Ecological Victory -- you believe in a green universe, 100 systems have at least one 100% habitable planet.
